Hi I'm Ryan, I am a shop foreman and automotive technician by trade. Started out by learning Python and really enjoyed it. 
From there I have been playing around with Arduino's and Raspberry Pi to get a bit more experience and try out other languages. 
Been a fun journey and looking forward to continuing to learn and expand my skills.
